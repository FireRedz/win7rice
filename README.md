An html page with some java script with the contents of the ["4chan Windows 7 Resource"][0] I created in late 2012. Some guy offered to help create an html page to make it easier to navigate, but updates were never done. Thus it is being forked, updates will occur, and the page will be restyled slightly to suit my needs. 
The html page is by no means a "guide" and is intended as a resource and index of helpful links that are easier to navigated and divided into categories.
